        <p>
            This here is my first game ever, "Chips". It's an early work in progress, with basic graphics
            (and even instructions here with barely any CSS), but the engine's core is working quite well.
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Instructions:</b>
            <p>
                You and your opponent have five elements, called "chips", that shoot each other. You're the
                one in the left, your opponent is in the right. They shoot bullets at the opposing chips on
                the same y axis, but one at a time. To choose which chip will shoot, you pick one by clicking
                on them. You actually shoot by clicking the green "Shoot!" text. Each time your shot hits the target,
                you're awarded points.
                <p>
                    Whenever shots meet, they interact in such ways:
                </p>
            </p>
            <p><b>Water (blue):</b> Wins over red shots, loses to light blue shots;</p>
            <p><b>Fire (red):</b> Wins over light blue shots, loses to blue shots;</p>
            <p><b>Ice (light blue):</b> Wins over blue shots, loses to red shots;</p>
            <p><b>Shadow (dark grey):</b> Loses to all shots, gives you more points when it hits;</p>
            <p><b>Light (light grey):</b> Wins over all shots, gives you less points when it hits;</p>
            <p>
                In case you're wondering, water, fire and ice shots give you 100 points,
                shadow shots give you 150 points, and light shots give you 65 points.
            </p>
            <p>
                Once in every five turns, the players have an opportunity to swap places of two
                neighboring chips. It's called a "switch turn". In this case, if you select a chip
                above the middle one, the selected chip will swap places with the one directly below it.
                Otherwise, if you choose a chip below the middle one, it'll swap places with the one above it.
                If you select the middle one, your chips will not change position at all.
            </p>

            <p>
                Currently, the game ends in the 30th turn, and whoever gets the most points wins.
                Don't feel bad if you lose, right now you and your opponent's chips are given randomly,
                so it's possible you've been given a bad deck. Hope you enjoy this early draft!
