# chips
A small (WIP) HTML5 game I'm making. I just started, so if you happen to stumble upon this, please don't mind, it's very incomplete as of today. However, it's already playable!

## Known bugs
* In a few select situations, the AI may crash. I still haven't found out why, but it's related to how it decides which chip it'll activate.
* If you resize the window, some things will break *(almost fully fixed!)*.
* Maybe config keys won't work. If they do, keys like Page Down, End and Down Arrow will keep moving the window, so avoid using those for now.
* The config page has a minor glitch where the words are offset from the middle. It snaps back to the middle when the screen is resized.
