# Chips
A small HTML5 game I'm making. It's now mostly finished, but there's still some adjustments left to make and browser compatibility may be low.

## Known bugs
* In a few select situations, the AI may crash. I still haven't found out why, but it's related to how it decides which chip it'll activate. *Probably fixed! May need more playtesting*
* Maybe config keys won't work. If they do, keys like Page Down, End and Down Arrow will keep moving the window, so avoid using those for now.
* If you click the new turn button before shots hit or vanish, there may be minor glitches.
