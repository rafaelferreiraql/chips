# chips
A small (WIP) HTML5 game I'm making. I just started, so if you happen to stumble upon this, please don't mind, it's very incomplete as of today. However, it's already playable!

## Known bugs
* If you resize the window, some things will break.
* Sometimes the AI breaks for whatever reason (related to the algorithm it uses to choose a chip to use). Still not found the source. *(maybe fixed!)*
